# React Native Real-time Chat Application

This is a real-time chat application built using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). It allows users to log in, choose a username, and engage in real-time chat conversations with other users. The app utilizes [Firebase Cloud Firestore's real-time API](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/listen) to provide instant updates and synchronization of chat messages between users.
